## Description

<!-- Please only use this template for submitting enhancement requests -->

**What would you like to be added**:
I would like to support the ML pipeline toolkit, [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines).

**Why is this needed**:
The Kubeflow Pipelines is the production-grade MLOps pipeline that is widely known and used in many productions.

**Completion requirements**:

This enhancement requires the following artifacts:

- [ ] Design doc
- [ ] API change
- [ ] Docs update

The artifacts should be linked in subsequent comments.
The Kueflow Pipelines internally uses the Argo workflow's Emissary Executor. So, although we may be able to support the kubeflow pipelines once we resolve #74, we need to investigate whether or not we need to implement some features/controllers for this integration.
