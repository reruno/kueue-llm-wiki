## Description

<!-- Please only use this template for submitting enhancement requests -->

**What would you like to be added**:
We are interested in bringing the visibility API to the cohort level (ie showing ordering within the borrowing pool).

⭐️ Understandably, some initial technical issues we would need to address in relation is how this would work when **hierarchical cohorts** and **fair sharing** is introduced.

For an initial implementation, it could make sense to just address FIFO. 

**Why is this needed**:
We have a transitionary state where we have this:
- Org CQ: holds all nominalQuota
- team-a CQ: no nominalQuota, just depends on cohort borrowing
- team-b CQ: no nominalQuota, just depends on cohort borrowing
- etc.

We don’t want to do this:
- team-a namespace: has localQ that points to Org CQ
- team-b namespace: has localQ that points to Org CQ

The latter has issues with CQ scaling. It would also trap us from transitioning to giving teams nominalQuota in the future. (For various internal compatibility reasons, we just want our initial iteration to offer no nominalQuota per team.)

**Completion requirements**:
Showing some type of queue ordering or pending API against the borrowing pool. 

This enhancement requires the following artifacts:

- [ ] Design doc
- [ ] API change
- [ ] Docs update

The artifacts should be linked in subsequent comments.
