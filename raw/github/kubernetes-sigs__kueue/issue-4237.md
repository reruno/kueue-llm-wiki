## Description

**What would you like to be added**:

Currently the ReclaimablePods feature is only supported for batch/Jobs. 

I would like to support it for all built-in integrations, unless for some this is not possible.

However, the graduation status of the KEP https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/blob/main/keps/78-dynamically-reclaiming-resources/README.md is unclear. I would like to revisit the state, and review for which Jobs the support is possible.

Also, solve the related bug https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/issues/3141 which may or may not require API update.

As we support the other Jobs we may need to protect the support by feature gates, so I would like to refresh the KEP and extend with the feature gates.

**Why is this needed**:

- to provide complete functionality to the users
- to solve the remaining bugs in the functionality
- to make a clear statement about the graduation of the feature. 

**Completion requirements**:

This enhancement requires the following artifacts:

- [x] Design doc
- [x] API change
- [x] Docs update

The artifacts should be linked in subsequent comments.

It's been on our feature list for AppWrappers for a while (https://github.com/project-codeflare/appwrapper/issues/51).  The main hesitation was that only a handful of other integrations had implemented it so it didn't seem worth the effort yet.
