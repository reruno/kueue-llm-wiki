## Description

<!-- Please only use this template for submitting enhancement requests -->

**What would you like to be added**:

See: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/issues/3922

**Why is this needed**:

In some K8s environments non-admin users are allowed to make new namespaces, but can't be allowed to create LocalQueues without further policy enforcement. This issue is to add documentation on how to achieve fine-grained access control to ClusterQueues by using Validating Admission Policies or Kyverno policies

**Completion requirements**:

Two new docs showing how to bind CQ permissions to certain groups

This enhancement requires the following artifacts:

- [ ] Design doc
- [ ] API change
- [x] Docs update

The artifacts should be linked in subsequent comments.
