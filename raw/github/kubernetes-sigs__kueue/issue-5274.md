## Description

<!-- Please only use this template for submitting enhancement requests -->

**What would you like to be added**:
It would be nice if we can specify separated preemption policy that should be applied for cross-cohort reclamation when using hierarchical cohort. Currently, as stated in [KEP](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/tree/main/keps/79-hierarchical-cohorts#proposal), reclamation happens among the whole cohort structure.

**Why is this needed**:
Users may need to specify different reclamation policy for cross-cohort reclamation when using hierarchical cohort to manage multiple teams. For example, within a team, users may want `reclaimWithinCohort: LowerPriority` so that reclamation happens based on priority. However, when it comes to reclaiming their resources used by other teams, they may want `reclaimWithinCohort: Any` to reclaim regardless of priority because they do not care about priority of other teams.

**Completion requirements**:

This enhancement requires the following artifacts:

- [ ] Design doc
- [ ] API change
- [ ] Docs update

The artifacts should be linked in subsequent comments.
