## Description

<!-- Please only use this template for submitting enhancement requests -->

**What would you like to be added**:
Introduce a new status called `Evicting` to enhance ongoing eviction logging. 
Full context here: https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/pull/6444#issuecomment-3153469374

> mimowo: I would love to actually have some better tooling to trace workloads for which Eviction is initiated (Evicted=True) but not completed yet (QuotaReserved=False || Finished). I think a good start might be to enrich the logging in WorkloadController around[here](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/blob/main/pkg/controller/core/workload_controller.go#L723-L735) where the workload.Status returns the "current" and "prevStatus". I think it could be helpful to introduce the new status like "Evicting" for the logging purposes.

**Why is this needed**:
It is difficult to understand what is happening after eviction has started and when either the quota reservation is removed or when the workload is finished. May also want to include when Active is set as false.
