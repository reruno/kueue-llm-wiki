## Description

<!-- Please only use this template for submitting enhancement requests -->

**What would you like to be added**:

Related to: [https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/issues/6998#issuecomment-3332153965](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kueue/issues/6998#issuecomment-3332153965)

It is currently difficult to determine which condition types are supported and what the purpose or significance of each condition is.

**Why is this needed**:

Beyond the general benefits of clearer documentation, this would be especially valuable for new contributors getting up to speed with the Kueue project. Since the Kueue Workload is the centerpiece of the system’s functionality, we should document every attribute as fully as possible.

**Completion requirements**:
Documentation should provide a complete list of all supported workload condition types, with either brief or expanded details. Each condition should include:

* **Lifecycle** — whether it is a *Terminal* or *Transient* condition.
* **Purpose** — whether it is *Reflective* (describing observed state) or *Spec-like* (driving subsequent processing logic; e.g., some conditions today act as spec).
* **Other notes** — any additional details or nuances relevant to the condition.

This enhancement requires the following artifacts:

* [ ] Design doc
* [ ] API change
* [x] Docs update

The artifacts should be linked in subsequent comments.

The Kubernetes project currently lacks enough contributors to adequately respond to all issues.

This bot triages un-triaged issues according to the following rules:
- After 90d of inactivity, `lifecycle/stale` is applied
- After 30d of inactivity since `lifecycle/stale` was applied, `lifecycle/rotten` is applied
- After 30d of inactivity since `lifecycle/rotten` was applied, the issue is closed

You can:
- Mark this issue as fresh with `/remove-lifecycle stale`
- Close this issue with `/close`
- Offer to help out with [Issue Triage][1]
